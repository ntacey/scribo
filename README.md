This app seeks to be a better way to organize your thoughts and notes than storing it in traditional documents like Google Docs, but also be a simpler tool than other solutions like Evernote. 

I have a previous version of this app in vanilla js, but the code was quickly becoming hard to maintain so I am refactoring it to use react and redux instead. 

This is also my first journey into react-redux and I hope to use it as a way to learn.

I plan on also learning react-native and creating a mobile version and eventually converting to a progressive web app.
